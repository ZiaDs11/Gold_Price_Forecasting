Gold Price Forecasting API 📈
This repository hosts a machine learning project designed to forecast the price of gold using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. The forecast model is served via a FastAPI web application, allowing for easy integration and real-time predictions.

✨ Features
LSTM Model: Utilizes an LSTM network, which is highly effective for sequence prediction problems like time series forecasting.

Scalable API: The prediction service is exposed via a robust and fast FastAPI interface.

Dockerized Deployment: The entire application is containerized with Docker for consistent and easy deployment across environments.

Data Preprocessing: Includes a saved data scaler to ensure prediction input is processed identically to the training data.
